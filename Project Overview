RAG-Based Question Answering System
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model built using FAISS for document retrieval and Falcon-7B (Hugging Face) for text generation. The system enables efficient question answering (QA) using a knowledge base.

🚀 Project Overview
🔹 Objective: Build a RAG-based QA system that retrieves relevant context from stored documents and generates accurate responses.
🔹 Retrieval Mechanism: Uses FAISS to store and search embedded documents.
🔹 Language Model: Leverages Hugging Face's Falcon-7B API for response generation.
🔹 Implementation: Structured in a Google Colab notebook with step-by-step explanations.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (for data processing and model integration)
FAISS (for efficient vector search)
Hugging Face Transformers (for embeddings & text generation)
Google Colab (for execution & documentation)
Requests (for API calls)

🏗️ How It Works
1️⃣ Document Storage & Embeddings
Text documents are embedded using Hugging Face's text embeddings.
FAISS stores these embeddings for fast similarity search.
2️⃣ Retrieval Mechanism
The system takes a user query, converts it into an embedding, and retrieves the top-k relevant document chunks.
3️⃣ Response Generation
The retrieved context and query are passed to Falcon-7B, which generates a well-informed answer.

🔑 Environment Variables
Ensure you do not hardcode API keys in the notebook.
